- Setting 1: ScatterNet classifiers and the end-to-end CNNs (>=10 layers)

    - reference1_cifar10.png comes from Figure 1(c) [Differentially Private Learning Needs Better Features (or Much More Data)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.11660) published in ICLR 2021. We can use this figure to argue that resnet18eps0.76.png results are OK.

    - reference2_cifar10.png comes from Figure 3 [Tempered Sigmoid Activations for Deep Learning with Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14191) published in AAAI 2021. We can use this figure to argue that resnet18eps0.76.png results are OK. We know that the model they use is >=10 layers from their table 2.
